blacksmith_price
That's great to know my prices are affordable for you.
Uh... I'm sorry if the prices are high... my life isn't the best right now, especially financially.
store
It doesn't bother me because we are both essential to this kingdom, as we are the only ones.
tavern
How wonderful it was to go to the tavern in the old days, with joy reigning and drinking without a care in the world.
I could go to the tavern, it's been years since I've been there.
villages
I've only heard about this village and the others... I don't know how I feel... an obligation to stay in this blacksmith shop... as if every day were the same.
I don't know it, but I'll go there someday.
help
Hey... how can I help you?
You're interested in the merchandise but need help, right?
classes
No offense intended, but in that kingdom there were few of your kind; you were the most fearless of them all.
economy
something difficult to obtain easily in Eldora
npcs
my friend... actually, a very good person.
compliments
I'm glad you liked my service, because if you hadn't, you wouldn't have had anywhere else to buy from...

May God guide your hand.

You...you came here with the promise to save those who suffered so much just by being there...but you killed them...you killed those in whom the hope of a happy kingdom like before lingered...you had that power...and that's why they were there....
If hope is the last thing to die...you should already be dead.

Look... I'm sorry, Eldora's economy isn't doing very well these days.
2
That's good to know, because nowadays everything is much harder to buy in Eldora.

That's true, because 5 years ago that king promised to return Eldora to its golden age, but the opposite happened; now we are going through this dark age.

[3]Why do you always have a depressed look on your face?

1
Drunk: Because I have nowhere left to hide my depression.
After hearing this, you'll be moved and leave.
2
After the events that destroyed the kingdom, I lost my reason for living and now I'm here drinking to forget my past.
You reflect on what he says and leave questioning your own life.
3
Because in this world, no matter what you do, they will always try to discourage you and make you give up on your dreams. That's what envy does to people; if they see that you have a prosperous life, they will try to take it from you instead of striving for it themselves.
You reflect on what he says and leave questioning your own life.

You approach the hero and greet him.
He greets you back and asks how he can help.
[1] What happened to this kingdom?
[2]who ruled Eldora before?
[3]what is in that dungeon
[4]Want to join my gang?
What do you want to ask?
1
Five years ago, monsters, beasts, and curses began attacking the kingdom, and only the knights, heroes, and fearless survived.
(1) Why did the drunkard survive?
(2) Do you know why everyone died?
(3) exit

1
Well, I don't even know how that drunkard ended up here.
2
Yes, I know. After everything that happened, the monsters took the 10 artifacts; they sustained everything that existed in Eldora.
3
Thank you very much for informing me, my dear hero.
2
It was King Dargan; he caused the downfall of the kingdom because he didn't care about the safety of the people and made a pact with the devil.
3
No one knows, because those who entered never returned.
4
I would accept that proposal, but with one condition: of all the winnings from the battle, 20% will be mine.
Do you accept this proposal? (yes) or (no)
